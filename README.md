# Metalcore-Memory-Game:

This is a one-player memory game, in which the player will try to match all album covers. The player has to complete all sets under 60 seconds.

## How to Get Started:

The player will navigate to the webpage and the timer will immediately start. The player can choose to reset the timer and start over.

## Rules:

1. The player will flip over two pictures, one at a time.
2. The boxes will automatically flip, if the player does not match the photo albums.
3. Each set will stay revealed if the pictures match. Otherwise, they are flipped again.
4. The game ends when all the pictures are matched.
