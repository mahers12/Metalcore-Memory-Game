# Metalcore-Memory-Game:

In this memory game, the player will try to match eight album covers. The player has to complete all sets under 60 seconds.

## Rules:

1. The player will flip over two pictures, one at a time.
2. The boxes will automatically flip, if the player does not match the photo albums.
3. Each set will stay revealed if the pictures match. Otherwise, they are flipped again.
4. The game ends when all the pictures are matched.
